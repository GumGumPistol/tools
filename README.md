# Tools
A collection of tools I use on a day to day basis.

## Sublime Text
Multi-cursor, easy split panes, intuitive keyboard shortcuts, configurable, etc.  Just works.

### What about Atom?
I also use Atom, but found little things that kept pushing me away.  I think Atom looks awesome, but just not as solid as Sublime Text...yet.

## ZSH
CD completion, path expansion, themes.
